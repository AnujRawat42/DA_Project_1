# DATA ANALYSIS OF NAUKRI.COM DATASET USING PYTHON

 Whenever we are looking for a job, we always prefer the high paying jobs, skills that are in demand, experience that the industry is expecting from us and many other important thingsÂ . Now its very difficult to go through each job and see about what's the highest pay, where it is located, what is the required experience. This is where the task of data analytics comes in. In this project, I will be doing the cleaning, manipulation, and visualization of the naukri_com-job_sample data.
 Data=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a34bCzgOHcdq5qdhiNvCXKl9IR4mb9te/view

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Student who is learning about Data and continously upgrading my skills with new tech tools and trying to make some projects using them.


## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?



while building this project i learned how can we clean data using some other ways like defining a function and applying it to another columns to automate the work and some new ways to visualize the relation between two varialbles like Stripplot.


I struggled quite a lot at cleaning the payrate and experience features as both of them had more than 2 variables after surfing a lot on internet i solved it  

## ðŸ›  Skills
-Python,MS Excel,Jupyter,Sql
## PS
I haven't explained my code here as i have already done it on medium, link(https://tinyurl.com/42sccmyz)
and if you want to see the further explanation, i have written it in the code itself as comments, so you can check my DA_Project.ipynb file. 

THANK YOU !
